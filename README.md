Spotify Clone

# challanges faced,
- I installed wrong package named tailwind insted of tailwindCSS
  - corrected it and issue is solved

# what does it do
- window.open
- redirect uri
- window.opener
- window.location.hash
- window.location.href.includes("error")
- what is hash from the window.location?
- popstate event
- state
- serializable object

# To do
- profile picture -> done
- Circular,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif have this fonts -> done
- add scrollbar and its color to playlists
- modify scroll function for title

# Notes
  # Tailwind
  - h-full	=> height: 100%; 100% of the container height
    h-screen	=> height: 100vh; full screen reagardless of container size

# Learnings
- When element is generated using loop and if it gets too big, avoid using `innerHTML += element` , to flood the area
  - instead create a new element and append it in every itteration
